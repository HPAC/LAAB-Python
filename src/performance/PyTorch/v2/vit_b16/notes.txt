cpu batch size: 1 takes 0.49 sec
A100 batch size: 220

48 CPU cores + 4 A100 GPUs ==> 44 + 4*220 = 924 images

size of 924 images = 924*3*224*224*4/1024/1024 = 530 MB for every hald a second..

so input req approx 1 GB per sec

JUWELS booster capacity: 200Gbitsx4 = 800 Gbits = 100 GB/s ==> needs only 1/100th of the link capacity..
